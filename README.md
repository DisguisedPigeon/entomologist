## Usage

### Setup

```sh
gleam add entomologist
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using this library, you have to add this to your sql migrations.
> If you don't have any migration system, dbmate is a good option.

```sql
create type level as enum (
    'emergency',
    'alert',
    'critical',
    'error',
    'warning',
    'notice',
    'info',
    'debug'
);

create table if not exists logs (
    id bigserial not null unique primary key,
    message text not null,
    level level not null,
    module text not null,
    function text not null,
    arity int not null,
    file text not null,
    line int not null,
    last_occurrence bigint not null,
    resolved bool not null default false,
    muted bool not null default false
);

create table if not exists occurrences (
    id bigserial not null unique primary key,
    log bigint not null references logs(id) on delete cascade,
    timestamp bigint not null,
    full_contents json
);

create table if not exists tags (
    id bigserial not null unique primary key,
    name text not null unique
);

create table if not exists log2tag (
    log bigserial not null references logs(id) on delete cascade,
    tag bigserial not null references tags(id),
    constraint logtag_pkey primary key (log, tag)
);

```

<!--
-- Breadcrumbs
-- This comes from elixir's error_tracker. It's a list of strings to help find the occurrence's execution path.
-- Might add it later.

### Usage overview

You should add the following line into your main function.
This saves the pog connection for later logging and registers the DB as a logging backend.

```gleam
let assert Ok(Nil) = entomologist.configure(connection)
```

From now on, every log generated by your gleam or erlang code will be saved to the database.

> [!WARNING]
> I recommend changing the log level to the appropriate level as well,
> since entomologist will save all log levels above the configured logger minimum.

Entomologist also provides you with some utility functions to aid you with exception management through its api.

For more ergonomic but complex interactions, checkout [entomologist_extensions](https://www.github.com/DisguisedPigeon/entomologist-extensions)

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/entomologist>.

## Development
> [!NOTE]
> To run the tests there must be a postgres database running on localhost with user and password "postgres" and database name "test".
> The port is read from the POSTGRES_PORT environment variable and if not present, 5431 (the default postgres port - 1) is used.
> The tables will be automatically created.

```sh
gleam test  # Run the tests (have you read the note?)
```

### For nix users

This repository counts with a `flake.nix` with gleam, gitmoji and watchexec

## Namesake
From wikipedia:
> Entomology \[...\] is the branch of zoology that focuses on insects. Those who study entomology are known as entomologists
